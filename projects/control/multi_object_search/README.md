## Set-up
Follow the setup described for the [multi_object_search tool](/docs/reference/multi_object_search.md). 

## Running the example
Mobile manipulation tasks in the analytical environment can be run as follows:
```bash
python multi_object_search_demo.py
```

They demo either executes a training or evaluation instance. By default it will evaluate all evaluation-scenes for 75 episodes sequentially.
The following will list the most important flags in
